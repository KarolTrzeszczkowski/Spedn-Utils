# Spedn Utils

Small set of scripts I use in my workflow and language model for syntax highlighting.

## Scripts
- `cpush` counts non-push opcodes of spedn output
- `ecspedn` compiles the .spedn code and formats output so you can copy-paste it to Electron Cash plugin built from one of my plugins. Formatting is in `pyformat.sed` file.

# Syntax highlighting

To add language model execute:

    sudo cp spedn.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs
